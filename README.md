# Unity Python Real Time Avatar Tracking with MediaPipe

## ðŸš€ Overview
Welcome to Unity-Python-Real-Time-Avatar-Tracking-with-MediaPipe, where Unity meets Python and Google MediaPipe to bring your avatars to life with real-time full-body tracking! This project uses the MediaPipePose library to detect your body movements via your webcam, and then translates those movements into actions for any humanoid avatar inside Unity.
This project is designed for developers and AR enthusiasts alike, offering a flexible and multi-threaded solution that allows you to control avatars with your physical gesturesâ€”no special equipment needed!
Fun Fact: This project runs on separate threads for webcam reading, avatar animation, and game logicâ€”so you can experience smooth and immersive performance!
